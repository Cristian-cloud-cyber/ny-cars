    "5. If you are using Visual Studio Code Ide, which I warmly suggest, press Ctrl+Shift+P and Select for an Interpreter, so Find it in the file of your new environment and go for finding out the file python.exe, selecting it. \n",
    "5. Once that's done you have to give the environment a chance to arm itself with the requirements and then the libraries it needs to understand the code, so you have to rely on a file called 'requirements.txt' and install it with \"pip install -r requirements.txt\""
